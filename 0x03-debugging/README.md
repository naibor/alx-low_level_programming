##### Debugging

###### 0-main.c, main.h
- A file that tests the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
    - You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.
###### 1-main.c
- Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
    - Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
    - You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
###### 2-largest_number.c, main.h
- A program prints the largest of three integers.
    - Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
###### 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h
- This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
    - Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years
    - You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
    - You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427)
